# UpdateTranslator for Zotero

**UpdateTranslator** is a lightweight Zotero plugin that updates and adds support for Persian (Iranian) content websites not included in Zotero's official translators.

## 🌐 What Does This Plugin Do?

Zotero is a powerful research tool, but it lacks out-of-the-box support for many popular Persian academic and content websites. This plugin:

- Automatically installs or updates translators for Persian websites.
- Adds support for commonly used Persian e-book and literature platforms such as:
  - [Asmaneketab.ir](https://asmaneketab.ir)
  - [PersianPDF.com](https://persianpdf.com)
  - [LiteratureLib.com](https://literaturelib.com)
  - And several others to be added in future updates
- Keeps your Zotero ready for Persian research content.

## 🚀 How to Install

1. [Download the `.xpi` plugin file](#) from the latest release.
2. Open Zotero.
3. Drag and drop the `.xpi` file into the Zotero window.
4. Restart Zotero if prompted.

✅ Done! Your translators are now managed and updated.

## 📚 How It Works

After installation, the plugin integrates with Zotero’s translator system. It installs updated translators for Persian websites and periodically checks for new ones as they are released.

No data is shared or synced externally. Everything runs locally within Zotero.

## 🛠️ Developer Notes

- The plugin uses Zotero’s official plugin API.
- Translators are stored and updated from a local directory or remote Git repository.
- You can contribute by submitting translators for more Persian websites under [`/translators/`](./translators/).
